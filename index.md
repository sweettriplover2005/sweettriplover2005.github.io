# My Beautiful Portfolio
I'm a student at CSUF studying Computer Engineering, and I hope to graduate by 2028! :3

## Labs

* Lab 2, Part 1 ||
	I really liked this lab because I found out how to calculate one’s metabolic rate by translating an established equation into one that we can throw numbers in. I really loved this lab because it was the first lab that really let me use what we learned in class to complete a certain task. I also think it wasn’t too hard either, and I can reflect back on the lab with what I know now, and think it’s interesting that we didn’t really use functions yet.

* Lab 3, Part 2 ||
	Lab three focused on two parts as well, but I liked both of them because of the introduction of functions. My favorite out of the two though was probably part 2, just because it’s after the entire trial-and-error process of part 1, so everything was starting to click. I also just liked it because I think about how a code that is a secret number game can be applied to real life, whether it be in video games or cybersecurity.

* Lab 11 || 
	Lab eleven focused on Object Oriented Programming and taught us the basics of objects. I think this was my least favorite lab because I feel like our lectures sorta brushed everything off and it was such a radically different way of programming from what I’m used to. I think the main issue I had with both parts is how vague the instructions are, and the fact that the preset code that is left for us is not in the correct form in which the linter wants.
